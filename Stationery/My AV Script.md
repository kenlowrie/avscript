{:.review}--- revTitle Notes to Reviewers
    Please send me any and all feedback, preferably by marking up the PDF using embedded comments. If you edit the PDF text directly, be sure to change your font color so that I can easily find the changes.
    Notes that begin with "VOICEOVER NOTE", can be ignored; they are for the voiceover guy.
    Additions ++are now marked like this++ and deletions ~~are now marked like this~~
    Thanks in advance for reviewing and commenting on the script!

{:.section}--- divTitle Introduction Section
    For complete information on what you can use inside these markdown files, refer to the userdocs.md file that's included with avscript_md.py. This file provides a very basic starting template.

You can create an email hyperlink using the syntax shown below.
[feedback]:mailto:email@yourdomain.com?subject=Your%20Film%20Title%20Feedback

Now, when I write &#91;feedback], it will be substituted like this: [feedback]

{:.section.vo.width90}@@@ divTitle Voiceover NOTES
    Pronounce Widget Model names as follows:
    AAT-08 --> AAT Zero Eight
    AAT-15 --> AAT Fifteen
    AAT-30 --> AAT Thirty
    I'm trying to be consistent about how I write them in the script, but just in case, use this as your guide. :)

{:.section}--- divTitle Header
    And this is a section header.
    With some additional information.
    {:.bigandbold}You can use class prefixes on these lines

{:.question}Inline question

{:.vo}Inline vo notes

The {: .classname} tag allows you to apply a specific class to the following text.
{:.note}This is a note
{:.red.note}This is a red note

The --- or @@@ prefix inserts a DIV. An optional title class and title can be specified too.

Most of the block level elements like DIVs, Headings, etc., will cause the floats to be reset. You can also force this by using the @break keyword at the start of a line.

{:.ignore}This line will not render in the output, but will be part of the HTML document.
