- VIDEO NOTES

**VOICEOVER NOTE**\n\n
VO DUDE: Pronounce AAT Model names as follows:\n\n
AAT-08 --> AAT Zero Eight\n
AAT-15 --> AAT Fifteen\n
AAT-30 --> AAT Thirty\n\n
I'm trying to be consistent about how I write them in the script, but just in case, use this as your guide. :)
{: .vo }

- [@]:MS:SHOT 1 described here

Audio and Voiceover for Shot 1

And here are some AV Script specific things:

You can force a newline by using \\n inline. For example:\nYou can see how the line break happened...

Use ++This is new stuff++ for new items added, or ~~this is old stuff~~ for things removed.

***Triple Stars for bold italics in red***

- [@]:CU:SHOT 2 described here

--- Section "Header"
    And this is a section header.
    With some additional information.
    ### You can use tags here
    
You can also add classes to any markdown tag.

- Try this in a shot

Inline question
{: .question }

Inline vo notes
{: .vo }

Do some inline formatting, like code formatting using back ticks, as I'm `doing inline right here` see? Actually, you can't really see, because I'm already using a ***fixed width*** system font for the VO script...

The {: .classname} tag allows you to apply a specific class to the preceeding text.
{: .noteTitle }

The --- or @@@ prefix inserts a DIV with an ID set to parameter 1, an optional TITLE and an optional CLASS name to format that title.

By putting a section in with no title, it will clear the floats and allow the page breaks to work...
{: .ignore}

@@@ section ""

@@@ section "Shotlist, images and screen captures for Video" pbb

///Shotlist///
